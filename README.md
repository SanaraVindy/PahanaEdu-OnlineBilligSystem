# PahanaEdu-OnlineBillingSystem
Responsive online billinng system for PahanaEdu Bookshop-Colombo

The PahanaEdu online billing system is a distributed application designed with a modern, two-tier architecture. It separates a responsive web-based frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, from a robust Java-based backend. This design ensures high scalability and maintainability.

The backend uses key design patterns like MVC, the Service Layer, and the DAO pattern to organize code logically and separate concerns. For data management, it relies on a MySQL database and leverages advanced features such as stored procedures and triggers to handle complex logic and automate tasks like inventory updates, ensuring data integrity.
